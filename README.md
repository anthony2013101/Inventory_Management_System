# Enhanced Inventory Management System within Curriculum Scope Project

This project is an enhanced Inventory Management System developed within the curriculum scope constraints, focusing on variable data types, conditionals, loops, classes, objects, database operations, and interactive challenges.

### Features:

#### Functionality:
- Manage product inventory with variables, lists, and dictionaries, including CRUD operations and interactive challenges for sorting and searching functionalities.
- Develop user authentication using basic conditionals and exception handling, and implement data analysis and reporting features based on stored data.

#### Database Management:
- Set up MySQL using basic operations (DDL, DML, DQL) for storing product information and managing product categories within the inventory system.

### Optional Challenges:
- Implement cost analysis functions, performance optimization, custom reporting features, and interactive inventory challenges within the curriculum scope.

### How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a local MySQL server and configure the database connection in the code.
3. Run `python main.py` to start the Enhanced Inventory Management System.

Customize and enhance the features within the curriculum boundaries for an enriching hands-on learning experience in database management and inventory control!
