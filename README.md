# Inventory Management System (NBA Merchandise Store)

A project exploring object-oriented design principles and SQL database integration. I built an inventory management system for a simulated "NBA Store."

### Features:

#### Functionality:
- Manage product inventory with variables, lists, and dictionaries, including CRUD operations and interactive challenges for sorting and searching functionalities.

#### Database Management:
- Set up MySQL using basic operations (DDL, DML, DQL) for storing product information and managing product categories within the inventory system.

### User Interface:
